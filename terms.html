  11. Accessibility Statement
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Our Commitment to Accessibility</strong><br>
    TRIBAL is committed to making its website accessible and user-friendly for
    all visitors, regardless of ability. We invest time, expertise, and
    creativity to improve accessibility across our digital platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our website follows the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C)
    <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA</strong>,
    supporting users who are blind, have cognitive disabilities, visual
    impairments, or other accessibility needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    We provide an accessibility interface that allows visitors to customize the
    website’s user interface and design based on their individual preferences
    and requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessibility is an ongoing effort. We regularly review, audit, and test our
    website to ensure our web properties meet or exceed accessibility standards.
  </p>

  <h3> 12. Limitations & Ongoing Improvements</h3>

  <p>
    While we strive for full accessibility, some content may not yet be fully
    accessible due to third-party integrations, embedded iframes, or technical
    limitations beyond our direct control. Where this occurs, we aim to clearly
    identify limitations and offer reasonable alternatives when possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    We continuously enhance our accessibility tools by updating features and
    functionality in line with technological advancements and internal research.
  </p>

  <h3>13. Feedback & Support</h3>

  <p>
    If you experience difficulty accessing any part of the website or have
    suggestions for improvement, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:Support@tribaliii.com">Support@tribaliii.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We actively work to achieve and maintain compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA
    standards, although not all content may be fully accessible at all times.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Thank you,<br>TRIBAL Team-Mates</strong></p>
